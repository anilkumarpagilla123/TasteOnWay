# TasteOnWay (Food Delivery Website)

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive food delivery website that allows users to browse and order a variety of food items. The website will leverage front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP for the user interface, while the back-end will utilize MySQL as the database management system. The website will be hosted on a Tomcat server for efficient handling of user requests.

Key Features:
1)User Registration and Login: The website will provide a user registration system where new users can sign up and existing users can log in. Users will be required to create an account with their personal details to access the full functionality of the website.

2)Breakfast, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages Catalogue: The website will feature separate pages for breakfast, main course, desserts, and beverages. Each page will display a catalog of food items under the respective category. Users can browse through the available options and view details such as item names, descriptions, prices, and images.

3)Cart Functionality: Users will have the ability to add desired food items to their cart. The cart page will display a summary of the selected items along with the total cost. Users can modify the quantities, remove items, and proceed to the checkout process.

4)Logout Functionality: Users will have the option to log out of their accounts, terminating their active sessions and ensuring the security of their account information.

By utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP, MySQL, and hosting the website on a Tomcat server, this food delivery website will provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for users to browse, select, and order food items from different categories. The implementation of login, registration, catalog pages for breakfast, main course, desserts, and beverages, as well as a cart and logout functionality, will enhance the overall user experience and streamline the food delivery process.
